# GeorgianStockParser
A simple downloader for stocks issued in Republic of Georgia

=========
This package serves as a downloader for stocks issued in Republic of Georgia from the data on Georgian Stock Exchange (GSE) website. I create this little package during my college winter study internship in Republic of Georgia, and this package is intended for use of Association of Young Economists in Georgia
